## Signing requires a development team

If Xcode shows a **Signing** area with a **Status** alert icon, here's how to solve it.

Xcode may show a message such as **Signing requires a development team. Select a development team in the project editor.**

  * In the **Signing** section, choose the **Team** dropdown, and choose your Apple ID.

  * If there's no Apple ID, then you need to add yours: **Xcode menubar** → **Preferences** → **Accounts** → **⨁** → **Add Apple ID**
